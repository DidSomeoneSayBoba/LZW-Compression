-creates thingy, makes a dictionary with limited size based on bytesize
-converts numbers in dict to bytes
-writes bytes to file(boi.txt in tester)
it encodes and writes to file(probably)
it's lossless(probably)
adjustable bytesize(see tester)

UPDATE 9/17/21
i feel bad for you person
the encoder probably works; the decoder tries to read from binary but gets very strange numbers when it reads in from the encoded file
the rest of the decoder probably works afterwards but who knows whats happening on that line
check lines 132-140 for potential issues

if the code is turbobroken just tell me and ill fix it and just write the list of integers version that should skirt around this problem
